    int i2 = 20;

    int add() {
        return this.i1 + this.i2; //Line n1

        System.out.println(new Test72().add()); //Line n2
    }

}

/*
    i1 is a static variable and i2 is an instance variable. Preferred way to access static
    variable i1 inside add() method is by using 'i1' or 'Test.i1'. Even though 'this.i1' is
    not the recommended way but it works.

    And instance variable i2 can be accessed inside add() method by using 'i2' or 'this.i2'.
    Hence, Line n1 compiles successfully.

    As add() is an instance method of Test class, so an instance of Test class is needed to
    invoke the add() method. `new Test().add()` correctly invokes the add() method of Test
    class and returns 30. Line n2 prints 30 on to the console.
