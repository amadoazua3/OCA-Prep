/*
    `new StringBuilder(5);` creates a StringBuilder instance, whose internal char array's
    length is 5 but the internal char array's length is adjusted when characters are
    added/removed from the StringBuilder instance. `sb.append("0123456789");`
    successfully appends "0123456789" to the StringBuilder's instance referred by sb.

    delete method accepts 2 parameters: delete(int start, int end), where start is inclusive
    and end is exclusive.

    This method throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException for following scenarios:

    A. start is negative

    B. start is greater than sb.length()

    C. start is greater than end

    If end is greater than the length of StringBuilder object, then
    StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is not thrown and end is set to sb.length().

    So, in this case, `sb.delete(8, 1000);` is equivalent to `sb.delete(8, sb.length());` and
    this deletes characters at 8th index (8) and 9th index (9). So remaining characters are:
    "01234567".

    StringBuilder class overrides toString() method, which prints the text stored in
    StringBuilder instance. Hence, `System.out.println(sb);` prints 01234567 on to the
    console.
