/*
    ArrayList are different than arrays, though behind the scene ArrayList
    uses Object[] to store its elements.

    There are 2 things related to ArrayList, one is capacity and another is
    actual elements stored in the list, returned by size() method. If you
    don't pass anything to the ArrayList constructor, then default capacity
    is 10 but this doesn't mean that an ArrayList instance will be created
    containing 10 elements and all will be initialized to null.

    In fact, size() method will still return 0 for this list. This list still
    doesn't contain even a single element. You need to use add method or its
    overloaded counterpart to add items to the list. Even if you want to add
    null values, you should still invoke some methods, nothing happens automatically.

    In this question, new ArrayList<>(4); creates an ArrayList instance which can
    initially store 4 elements but currently it doesn't store any data.

    Another point you should remember for the certification exam: Addition of elements
    in ArrayList should be continuous. If you are using add(index, Element) method to
    add items to the list, then index should be continuous, you simply can't skip any index.

    In this case, list.add(0, "Array"); adds "Array" to 0th index. so after this operation
    list --> [Array].  You can now add at 0th index (existing elements will be shifted right)
    or you can add at index 1 but not at index 2. list.add(2, "List"); throws an instance of
    java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException.

        System.out.println(list);
    }
