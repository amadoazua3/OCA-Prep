/*
    Period.of(0, 0, 0); is equivalent to Period.ZERO. ZERO period is displayed as P0D,
    other than that, Period components (year, month, day) with 0 values are ignored.

    toString()'s result starts with P, and for non-zero year, Y is appended; for non-zero
    month, M is appended; and for non-zero day, D is appended. P,Y,M and D are in upper case.

    NOTE: Period.parse(CharSequence) method accepts the String parameter in
    "PnYnMnD" format, over here P,Y,M and D can be in any case.
