    main(String[] args) method goes on to the top of the STACK.

    1. ArrayList<Counter> original = new ArrayList<>(); => It creates an ArrayList
    object [suppose at memory location 15EE00] and variable 'original' refers to it.

    2. original.add(new Counter(10)); => It creates a Counter object [suppose at
    memory location 25AF06] and adds it as a first element of the ArrayList. This means
    element at 0th index of ArrayList instance refers to Counter object at the memory
    location 25AF06.

    3. ArrayList<Counter> cloned = (ArrayList<Counter>) original.clone(); =>
    original.clone() creates a new array list object, [suppose at memory location 45BA12]
    and then it will copy the contents of the ArrayList object stored at [15EE00]. So,
    cloned contains memory address of the same Counter object.

    In this case, original != cloned, but original.get(0) == cloned.get(0). This means both
    the array lists are created at different memory location but refer to the same Counter
    object.

    4. cloned.get(0).count = 5; => cloned.get(0) returns the Counter object stored at
    the memory location 25AF06 and .count = 5 means change the value of count
    variable of the Counter object (stored at memory location 25AF06) to 5.

    5. System.out.println(original); Prints the element of ArrayList original, which is:
    {25AF06} and toString() method prints: [Counter-5] as Counter object referred by
    [25AF06] is [Counter object (5)].
