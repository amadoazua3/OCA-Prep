/*
    Please note that Strings computed by concatenation at compile time, will be referred
    by String Pool during execution. Compile time String concatenation happens when
    both of the operands are compile time constants, such as literal, final variable etc.

    For the statement, String s2 = "OCAJP" + "";, `"OCAJP" + ""` is a
    constant expression as both the operands "OCAJP" and "" are String literals, which means the
    expression `"OCAJP" + ""` is computed at compile-time and results in String literal "OCAJP".

    So, during compilation, Java compiler translates the statement

    String s2 = "OCAJP" + "";

    to

    String s2 = "OCAJP";

    As "OCAJP" is a String literal, hence at runtime it will be referred by String Pool.

    When Test class is executed,

    s1 refers to "OCAJP" (String Pool object).

    s2 also refers to same String pool object "OCAJP".

    s1 and s2 both refer to the same String object and that is why s1 == s2 returns true.

    Please note that Strings computed by concatenation at run time (if the resultant
    expression is not constant expression) are newly created and therefore distinct.

    For below code snippet:

    String s1 = "OCAJP";
    String s2 = s1 + "";
    System.out.println(s1 == s2);
    Output is false, as s1 is a variable and `s1 + ""` is not a constant expression, therefore
    this expression is computed only at runtime and a new non-pool String object is created.

    }
