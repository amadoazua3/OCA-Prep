/*
    There is no compilation error. When Test class is loaded by JVM to invoked
    main(String []) method, static variable declaration and initialization statement is
    executed and false is assigned to flag as !true is false.

    As java Test AM PM command is used, so args[0] --> "AM" and args[1] --> "PM".

    In ternary operator, boolean expression is evaluated first, !flag evaluates to true and
    therefore agrs[0] is returned.

    AM is printed on to the console.
