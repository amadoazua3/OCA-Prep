    case values must evaluate to the same type / compatible type as the switch
    expression can use.

    switch expression can accept following:

    char or Character,

    byte or Byte,

    short or Short,

    int or Integer,

    An enum only from Java 6,

    A String expression only from Java 7.

    In this case, switch expression [switch (arr[i][j])] is of String type.

    Please note that break; statement at Line n4 takes the control to Line n6 (outside
    switch-case block) and not out of the inner for loop, where as, continue; statement at
    Line n5 takes the control to the update expression (j++) of Line n2.

    arr.length is 3, so outer loop executes 3 times.

    1st iteration of outer loop, i=0.

    -1st iteration of inner loop, i=0, j=0 and arr[0].length = 3. 0 < 3 evaluates to true.

      arr[0][0] = "7", Line n5 is executed, and it takes the control to j++ (j = 1). 1 < 3
      evaluates to true.

    -2nd iteration of inner loop

      arr[0][1] = "6", Line n4 is executed, and it takes the control to Line n6. 6 is printed
      on to the console. Control goes to j++ (j = 2). 2 < 3 evaluates to true.

    -3rd iteration of inner loop

      arr[0][2] = "5", Line n5 is executed, and it takes the control to j++ (j = 3).   As 3 < 3
      evaluates to false, control exits inner loop and goes to i++.

    You must have noticed that 1st iteration of outer loop prints the even number of 1st
    array { "7", "6", "5" }

    Similarly, 2nd iteration of outer loop prints the even number of 2nd array { "4", "3" },
    which is 4

    and 3rd iteration of outer loop prints the even number of 3rd array { "2", "1" }, which
    is 2.

    Therefore, the output is: 642.
