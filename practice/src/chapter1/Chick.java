/*
    Constructors I

    There are two key points to note about the constructor: the name of the constructor
    matches the name of the class, and there's no return type.

    When you see a method name beginning with a capital letter and having a return
    type, pay special attention to it. It is NOT a constructor since there's no
    return type. It's a regular method that won't be called when you write
    new Chick().
